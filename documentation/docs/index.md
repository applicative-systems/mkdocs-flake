## Try it

### Nix

The best way to use this project is via [Nix](https://nixos.org).

1. [Install Nix](https://nixos.org/download/)
2. Run this command inside your mkdocs project:
  ```console
  nix run github:applicative-systems/mkdocs-flake
  ```

That's it, you can live-edit your documentation.

To do more, as publishing it on GitHub automatically via your CI, please have
a look at our [integration docs](integration/index.md)

## Plugins

### Diagrams

[Mermaid](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/#usage)
works out of the box, but we also added [PlantUML]() support!

Plantuml is a bit more sophisticated than Mermaid and contains a
[standard library](https://plantuml.com/stdlib)
with many useful icons and styles.

```plantuml
@startuml
!include <logos/apple-pay>
!include <logos/dinersclub>
!include <logos/discover>
!include <logos/google-pay>
!include <logos/jcb>
!include <logos/maestro>
!include <logos/mastercard>
!include <logos/paypal>
!include <logos/unionpay>
!include <logos/visaelectron>
!include <logos/visa>
' ...

Worth mentioning is especially the [C4](https://c4model.com/) standard library:

```plantuml
@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Container>

Person(personAlias, "Label", "Optional Description")
Container(containerAlias, "Label", "Technology", "Optional Description")
System(systemAlias, "Label", "Optional Description")

System_Ext(extSystemAlias, "Label", "Optional Description")

Rel(personAlias, containerAlias, "Label", "Optional Technology")

Rel_U(systemAlias, extSystemAlias, "Label", "Optional Technology")
@enduml
```


### Code

The code blocks with annotation support as
[documented by mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/)
work out of the box:

``` py title="bubble_sort.py"
def bubble_sort(items):
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): # (1)
            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
```

1.  :man_raising_hand: I'm a code annotation! I can contain `code`, __formatted
    text__, images, ... basically anything that can be written in Markdown.

### Math

You can use [MathJax](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/math/#mathjax)
and [KaTeX](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/math/#katex)
out of the box:

$$
\operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
$$
